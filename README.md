# Digital Wall Clock with Arduino

This project features a digital wall clock built using an Arduino, a 4x7+1 Seven Segment Display, and a DS1302 RTC module.

Key Features:

Multiplexing & PWM: Efficient display control and brightness management implemented directly in the code.

Hardware: Optimized for 7-segment displays.

Important Notes & Recommendations:

RTC Accuracy: While this project uses the DS1302, it is known for slight time drift. For high-precision needs, I recommend upgrading to a DS3231.

Circuit Improvements: Suggestions for better pinout arrangements and more stable Voltage Regulator Modules (VRM) are welcome to enhance the current design.
